This project focuses on extracting and analyzing insights from personal or group WhatsApp chat data using Python. It involves reading exported chat files, cleaning and structuring the data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in user activity, message frequency, word usage, media sharing, and more. Visualizations are generated using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for a better understanding of the communication trends. The final product is packaged into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, which is then deployed on Heroku for public access. This end-to-end project demonstrates the practical application of data science, text processing, and cloud deployment to turn raw chat data into meaningful insights.
